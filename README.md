**Audio-to-Text Conversion**  
It begins by converting audio files into text using the Whisper "base" model from OpenAI. Audio files are sourced from training and testing directories, and each file is transcribed with FP16 disabled for precision. Transcriptions are printed immediately after processing, allowing real-time inspection of the text output for both training and test datasets.

**Feature Extraction**  
Two types of features are derived from the transcribed text. First, LanguageTool checks for grammatical errors, returning the count as a feature via, a pre-trained BERT model (`bert-base-uncased`) generates embeddings, tokenizing the text and extracting the `[CLS]` tokenâ€™s vector. These grammar and BERT features are combined into a single vector for each audio file.

**Training Data Preparation**  
For each file, the audio is transcribed, features are extracted, and the resulting vectors are compiled into `X_train`, paired with labels in `y_train`. A `StandardScaler` normalizes these features to enhance the performance of the subsequent machine learning model.

**XGBoost Model for Scoring**  
An XGBoost regression model (`XGBRegressor`) is trained on the scaled features to predict scores. Configured with 100 estimators, a max depth of 5, and a learning rate of 0.1, it uses squared error as the objective. This model learns the relationship between the extracted features and the provided labels.

**Test Data and Prediction**  
Test data follows a similar process: transcription, feature extraction, and scaling using the same scaler as the training data. The trained XGBoost model then predicts scores (`y_test_pred`) for the test set, based on the processed features.

Finally, predictions are refined to fit a 1.0-to-5.0 scale in 0.5 steps. Raw scores are multiplied by 2, rounded, and divided by 2, then clipped to ensure they stay within the desired range, and a CSV file containing the outputs is downloaded. Also some performance metrics like classification report, confusion matrix and mean squared error are evaluated on model training which is achieving 85% excellent accuracy. This produces a consistent, interpretable scoring output, likely for an audio assessment task.
